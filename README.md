# bank-ledger-9000

This is a small project for the Python backend elective with Django.

The requirements as of now are:

* A customer can have any number of bank accounts
* For future multi-factor authentication and other validation purposes, we must record the customerâ€™s telephone number
* The bank ranks its customers into three groups: basic, silver, and gold - the system must keep track of this information
* Customers ranked silver and gold can loan money from the bank
* Customers can make payments on their loans
* Customers can transfer money from their accounts if the account balance is sufficient
* Customers can view their accounts, accounts movements, and accounts balance
* Bank employees can view all customers and accounts
* Bank employees can create new customers and accounts and change customer rank
* Only allowed JavaScript import is HTMX
* Use a class-less CSS framework, and avoid unnecessary classes in your HTML
* Use Python 3.9 or newer, Django 4.0 or newer
